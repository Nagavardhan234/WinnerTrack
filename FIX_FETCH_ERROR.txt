# ⚠️ FIXING "Failed to Fetch" ERROR

## Problem:
You're using the EDIT link: 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F1PNgP_9sRpTQmWz-yzmFLHN8M2ML_CiJr8t44_2evA/edit

This won't work! You need the PUBLISHED CSV link.

## Solution - Follow These Steps:

### STEP 1: Open Your Sheet
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F1PNgP_9sRpTQmWz-yzmFLHN8M2ML_CiJr8t44_2evA/edit?usp=sharing

### STEP 2: Publish to Web
1. Click "File" (top menu)
2. Hover over "Share"
3. Click "Publish to web"
4. A dialog will open

### STEP 3: Configure Publishing
In the dialog:
1. First dropdown: Select your sheet name (probably "Sheet1")
2. Second dropdown: Change from "Web page" to "Comma-separated values (.csv)"
3. Click the green "Publish" button
4. Click "OK" on the confirmation

### STEP 4: Copy the CORRECT URL
After publishing, you'll see a URL like:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT...../pub?output=csv

☝️ THIS is the URL you need! It starts with "/d/e/2PACX-"

### STEP 5: Update config.js
1. Open: config.js
2. Find line: CSV_URL: 'PASTE_YOUR_PUBLISHED_CSV_URL_HERE',
3. Replace with your published URL
4. Make sure TEST_MODE: false,
5. Save

### STEP 6: Test
Refresh index.html - should load your data!

## Quick Reference:

❌ WRONG (Edit link):
/d/1F1PNgP_9sRpTQmWz-yzmFLHN8M2ML_CiJr8t44_2evA/edit

✅ CORRECT (Published CSV link):
/d/e/2PACX-1vT[long-string]/pub?output=csv

## Still Not Working?

### Option 1: Use Test Mode
Set TEST_MODE: true in config.js to see it working with sample data first

### Option 2: Check Your Sheet Format
Make sure your sheet has these exact columns:
Date | Participants | TournamentsPlayed | Teams | Winners

Example:
08-02-2026 | Naveen,Vardhan,Kishore,Vivek | 1 | Team A | 1-Naveen and Vardhan
